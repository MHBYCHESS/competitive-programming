# Soil_moisture_forecasting:
<p>
Can you predict what the soil moisture of an area of interest will be days in advance??<br/>
Well lets explore the posibilities with Machine-learning and see how we fair.
> * In this challenge we use machine learning to forecast/predict the soil moisture of the various agricultural fields as inferred from the dataset found [here(Zindi)](http://zindi.africa/competitions/wazihub-soil-moisture-prediction-challenge/data)
