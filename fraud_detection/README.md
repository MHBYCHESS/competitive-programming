# Fraud_detection using MachineLearning
<p>
This challenge aims to leverage the power of machine learning to aid credit fraud detection in financial instutions/service providers.Can you predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not??

> * The challenge is hosted on [Zindi](https://www.zindi.africa/competitions/xente-fraud-detection-challenge/) and the data can also be downloaded from the aforementioned link.
  * The solution above ```fraud_detection_model.ipynb``` places in the top 10%(55/547) using a Random Forest Classifier. Feel free to fork and do other things i didn't do to satisfaction like feature-selection, feature-engineering and more hyperparameter tuning.
> * Happy learning.
